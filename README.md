# Python Asteroids Clone

This is a clone of the game Asteroids which I made with Python. I made it to solidify my understanding of the OOP paradigm.

You can fly around and shoot at asteroids. If your shot hits the asteroid, it will split the asteroid into two smaller asteroids (unless it was already small). If you hit an asteroid, the program will end and that's game over!

## How to run it

First clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/fortunatebit/asteroids`

Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install the requirements from the provided "requirements.txt":
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, run main.py!
`python3 main.py`

## Controls

To move around the screen, use WASD. To shoot bullets, press spacebar. That's it!
